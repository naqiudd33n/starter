/*
This SQL query retrieves information about the top 10 tables from the 
information_schema.tables table, which contains metadata about all tables 
within the database. The query selects columns for the table name, 
table type, creation time, update time, and table schema. It orders 
the results by creation time in descending order, showing the most recently 
created tables first. This information is useful for understanding the 
structure and history of database tables.
